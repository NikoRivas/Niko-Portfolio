        <h3 class="title">Background</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii, and I now reside in Southeast Portland, Oregon. I'm a <span class="csm">Customer Success Manager</span> at a tech company and I'm learning how to code in my free time. I'm excited to learn how to code for the reasons below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I want to build beautiful and functional websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            More career growth opportunities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title">Interests</h3>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, gardening, film photography, reading, playing with my dog Frankie, and trying new restaurants with my husband Mikey.</p>
